# I-SED: Interactive Sound Event Detector

I-SED is a human-in-the-loop interface for sound event annotation that helps users label sound events of interest within a lenghty recording quickly. The system speeds up humanâ€™s searching for a set of sound events of interest in an audio recording

I-SED was developed as a part of [Bongjun Kim](https://www.bongjunkim.com/)'s PhD research in 2018. More details about the interface can be found in the following project pages: [https://www.bongjunkim.com/pages/projects/ised.html](https://www.bongjunkim.com/pages/projects/ised.html)

You can simply watch the demo video to understand how the interface works: [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Ss2eGSW4_4w)
